# Viu - Front End Application

**Viu is a web interface that allows Testers to automate the testing of their websites without the need
for any programming knowledge.** Viu connects to a Java API that uses the Vertex Framework to generate
the project source.

Users can create Projects, Page Objects, Element Selectors, and Tests through the Viu interface, and then
download the generated source that contains a complete and working test automation project.
